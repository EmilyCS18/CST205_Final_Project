To run this program, the user will need to confirm that they have all the necessary imports installed. Then, they can execute pokemon_search.py, enabling the entire application to run. Next, the user can input their desired Pok√©mon to retrieve information. Additionally, they will have access to a dropdown menu where they can select a berry to learn more about, receiving information specific to the selected berry.

In the future, this project has a lot of potential to be expanded upon. Through the PokeAPI, there are a lot more categories of information that we could potentially use to expand our program. 

important note from Emily Contreras:
I tried creating a separate file for the berry section and then integrating it with pokemon_search.py, but I encountered technical difficulties. As a result, I transferred the code to pokemon_search.py, and it worked, so I decided to leave it as is.
